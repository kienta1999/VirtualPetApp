# My Virtual Pet App

This is the creative portion that makes my app stands out:

## Sound:
I added sound to the app so:
- When the pet is fed, the eating sound will be played.
- When the pet is played with (and the food level > 0), the happy sound will be played.

## Icon status image
I added an additional icon so:
- When the pet is hungry (and the food level is 0), the sad icon will show up.
- When the pet is at hapiness level 10, the heart icon will show up.
- Otherwise, there will be no icon.
